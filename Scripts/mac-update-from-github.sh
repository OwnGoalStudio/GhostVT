# Replaces /Applications/iGhostVT.app with the macOS zip from a GitHub Release.
#
#   mac-update-from-github.sh [tag]
#
# Tag defaults to the latest release. The zip CI attaches is ad-hoc, so
# Gatekeeper quarantine has to come off; a live helper pins Background Task
# Management to the old cdhash, so the running app has to quit and the old
# agent has to go *before* the bundle is swapped. When the keychain holds a
# Developer ID Application identity the downloaded bundle is re-signed with
# it first: BTM keys a Team-ID signature's launch constraint on the team,
# not the cdhash, so the *next* update signed by the same team replaces the
# helper without tripping the constraint at all. MAC_UPDATE_IDENTITY
# overrides the choice; MAC_UPDATE_IDENTITY=- keeps the ad-hoc seal. The harness LaunchAgent
# (`make mac-run`) shares the label `wiki.qaq.ighostvtd` — leaving it loaded
# is the usual kSMErrorInvalidSignature after an install.
#
# Privileged steps (delete + copy into /Applications) go through sudo, which
# on this machine is Touch ID. Unprivileged: download, xattr, quit, bootout.
